I recently started working on [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com "Mozilla Firefox"). To be more specific, I help run the [Gecko Layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28layout_engine%29 "Gecko Layout Engine") Team for the [Mozilla Corporation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/moco.html "MoCo"). My team is responsible for everything you can “see” in Firefox. As you can imagine, the team is very busy.

I really enjoy working on software used by hundreds of millions of people. Before I started working on Firefox full-time, I managed Software Engineering for the [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/ "Adobe Flash Player"). Before that, I worked on [a bunch of other software](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jethrovillegas "My LinkedIn profile") used by lots of people. After 13 years at Adobe and [Macromedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia "MACR"), it was time for me to make a change.

I started looking for an opportunity that would let me continue working for a global audience and allow growth through new challenges. At Adobe, I had the opportunity to work with all the browser vendors to make sure that the Flash Player worked on [their products](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/systemreqs/ "supported browsers"). I really enjoyed working with the Mozilla people, so I reached out to let them know about my plans. [They’re hiring lots](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/careers.html "Jobs at Mozilla") of new staff and needed help on Engineering Leadership to scale the organization. After a very rigorous interview process, I started work on September 12, 2011.

In the short time I’ve been at Mozilla, it’s already clear that this place is run by Engineers. I love it! It feels a lot like Macromedia did when I started there in 1998. My first day on the job was at the San Jose Convention Center where the Mozilla employees had their All-Hands meeting. There was far more energy and enthusiasm at the Mozilla All-Hands than at the last event I saw at the Convention Center (which had 10x as many attendees!) Everyone at Mozilla is [definitely on a mission](http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html "Moz Mission") and charged up…

- It’s not enough to not be evil.
- It’s not enough to be good at what you do.
- You have to Do Good.
