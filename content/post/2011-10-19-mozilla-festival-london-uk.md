I will be in London from November 4-6 to take part in the [Mozilla Festival](http://mozillafestival.org/ "Moz Fest"). The festival will be at the [Ravensbourne College](http://www.rave.ac.uk/ "Ravensbourne College") in Greenwich (*in the beginning of time—[GMT](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ "GMT")*.)

The organizers are actively looking for more developers and designers to add rocket fuel for the Festival’s roster of design challenges and hack sprints. More specifically, they are looking for more:

- Javascript developers, HTML5 video and audio enthusiasts, front-end developers, news app developers, and other news hackers, to help build everything from data-driven journalism kits to mobile news apps to amazing browser-based video games that run right in the browser.
- User experience and interface designers, graphic designers, game developers, and 3D modeling people, to help create everything from data visualizations to translation workflow to whole new ways of imagining news and information.

Know anyone who fits the bill? Please ask them to join us in London by signing up here: [https://donate.mozilla.org/festival-register](https://donate.mozilla.org/festival-register "MozFest Registration")

If you have people in mind who would be perfect but could have a tough time paying the event fee, please [send me a note](mailto:jet@junglecode.net "Send me a note!"). We’ll find a way to get them in.
