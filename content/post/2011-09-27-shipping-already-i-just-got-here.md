[Firefox 7.0 shipped today](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/09/27/mozilla-firefox-significantly-reduces-memory-use-to-make-web-browsing-faster/ "Firefox 7 ships"). While I can’t take any credit for any of it, my team deserves all the praise. They’ve been hard at work on reducing memory all over the product. I’ve had a few people complain to me about “pork” in Firefox and we’re making some big changes to cut the fat. It’s interesting how getting a new job just means new complaints from the same cadre of “stakeholders.” Let me know via the blog comments if Firefox is working better (or not) with all these optimizations.
