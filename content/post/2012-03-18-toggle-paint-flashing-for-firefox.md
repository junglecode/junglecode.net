[Paint Flashing](http://www.junglecode.net/?p=110 "Firefox Invalidation") is now in the [official Release channel ](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/ "Firefox releases")starting in Firefox 11. I posted a new add-on that letâ€™s you enable Paint Flashing with one click: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-paint-flashing/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-paint-flashing/ "Paint Flashing Add-on")

This tool is useful for quickly inspecting how Firefox renders your web pages as it visually indicates how much screen area is being painted after the page layout is computed.The [source code](https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/addon/1044732/latest/ "src") for the add-on is also posted.
