The Platform Rendering team is back in Taiwan this month. This time, we’ve split the team across 3 work weeks (Media, Layout, and Graphics.) This lets us focus on the issues specific to each team but still allow for free time to hack and socialize.

This morning, the Layout team decided to take a walk up to Elephant Mountain near the office. A walk in the park with the Layout team has equal parts of viewing the scenery, and discussing rendering issues for Chinese text (both horizontal and vertical!) It was quite fun.

I’ll post the Platform Graphics team agenda in two weeks after they’re in Taiwan for their work week. Apologies for the use of acronyms and unfamiliar jargon as the Rendering teams often use these terms to describe complex features. Send me a comment if I can help clarify anything.

The Taiwan teams have been very gracious and welcoming as always. See you all again soon!
