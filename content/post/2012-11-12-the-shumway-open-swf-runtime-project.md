[Last year, I wrote a blog post regarding Flash](http://www.junglecode.net/?p=57 "Did Adobe finally kill Macromedia Flash?") that generated a fair bit of discussion. Since then, the Research team at Mozilla has been working on solutions:[ https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2012/11/12/introducing-the-shumway-open-swf-runtime-project/](https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2012/11/12/introducing-the-shumway-open-swf-runtime-project/ "Shumway")  
As the research blog states, “…Shumway is very experimental, is missing features, contains many defects, and is evolving rapidly.” If you’re a technical person who wants to help the current situation with Flash and the Open Web, please help us out.
